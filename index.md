## My projects

**Playlist Machine**\
A web app that creates playlists based on selected artist, track and genre. You can also set up audio features. This app lets you find music that is similar to artist you like, but e.g. more rythmic or upbeat.\
Tools: Python (Flask), Spotify Web API.

Besides my own projects, I enjoy helping others at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/9472575). Sometimes it's me who's the asker though :) but answering is more fun.
